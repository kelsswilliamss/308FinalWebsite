      <p>Hey there! My name is Kelsey, the girl behind the site! I'm a twenty-something year old who has a love for traveling and all things coffee. I have been to several different coutries in my short life and am ready to take on as many as possible. Most of my trips have been mission work or educational purposes. I have traveled to almost every state on the East Coast, and am working my way west to hit all forty-eight states, and hopefully the other two as well.</p>

      <p>I am currently a fifth-year Media Arts and Design student at James Madison University and will be graduating in May 2021! While being a full time student, I also am a small business owner. Kelsey Marie Photography was offically created three years ago and specializes in weddings and senior portraits. I also have a passion for helping other small businesses create content that reaches and relates to their ideal clients through customized branding sessions. While I am not the best at UX design, I have had a fun time in this SMAD 308 class learning a few new things. It is certainly very hard, but I hope you enjoy this final project site. I can't wait to see what happens next in life, and I am ready for the adventure!</p>

    <p>If there is one place I love the most to relax and catch up on rest, it's the beach! Just as much as my dad loves the mountains, my mom loves the beach! There's just something about sitting in the sand, listening to the waves crash on the shore and just simply soaking in the moment.</p>

    <p>I've been to quite a few beaches, in the US and outside of the country, so here are my must see list of recommendations on beaches to visit!</p>

    <p>1. Seaside, Florida and the 30A strip</p>
    <p>2. Panama City Beach, Florida</p>
    <p>3. Clearwater, FLorida</p>
    <P>4. Costa Rica</P>
    <p>5. Puerto Rico</p>

     <p>It's the city life for me! I absolutely love exploring new cities and towns. There's no such thing as a city without something to do, so whether you're visiting somewhere for a few hours or a few days, there's something there for you.</p>

     <p> I've visited quite a few cities in the US and across the world. So, this collection includes places all over. You probably will not be surprised by some of them, because they honestly do live up to their famous names.</p>

     <p>1. Paris</p>
     <p>2. London</p>
     <p>3. Amsterdam</p>
     <p>4. New York City</p>
     <p>5. Savannah</p>

    <h2 class="text-white">TIPS AND TRICKS</h2>
    <p>Whether you're traveling alone, or with your group, do your research! Have a plan or itenerary. If you're wanting to be more spontaneous then that's great, but make a plan for that. Have it in your schedule and have a little bit of knowledge about where you are going. If you don't have at least a little bit of a plan or idea about where you're going and what you're doing, there's a big chance you won't do anything at all. So I'll say it again - do you're research and make. a. plan.</p>

    <p>If you are traveling alone, definitely make sure someone else has your itenerary and that you are checking in with people about your where abouts. Even in the safest city in the world (does that even exist?) there's always a chance of something happening, where that's a medical emergency or something else. Another reason why having a plan is a smart decision.</p>

    <p>I'll touch on this more, but pack lightly and only pack your essentials. Unless you are planning a long trip with different big events involved, you really only need the basics for clothing and the essentials like a toothbrush and toothpaste. The lighter you pack, the less you'll stress when is comes to getting from place to place.</p>

    <p>Budgeting your trip is extremely important if you're trying to save money. Determine how much you're willing to spend and make a spreadsheet with all of your costs and stick to it!</p>

    <h2>PACKING</h2>
     <p>I know that when it comes to packing, that can be a very stressful situation. What do I wear, what if something happens, what if it's cold or really hot, etc. and so many other what if situations. Here's my normal routine when it comes to packing and making sure that I am set for the road!</p>

     <p>1. Do the obvious: charge everything, and I do mean everything! Camera, cell phone, laptop, iPad, batteries, anything that needs charging, charge it the night before you leave.</p>

     <p>2. Keep all your enterainment digitally: If you love reading books or magazines on the plane or in the car, download them to your laptop or iPad. Keeps you from having that extra clunk in your bag. Download movies or shows as wellso you don't have to pay for wifi.</p>

     <p>3. Write a list of what all you need to pack: Think about your itenerary and plan accordingly. Try to pick outfits that are easily diversible and can be worn to many different occasions, aka be dressed up or down.</p>

     <p>4. Use that list as a shopping list: When heading to the store grab travel sizes of everything. Only pink up the neccesaties</p>

     <p>5. Using packing cubes or vacuum out the air to create more room in your bag or use a smaller suticase. Traveling light is key!</p>

    <h2 class="text-white">PLACES TO STAY</h2>
    <p>One of the most costly parts of traveling is having to pay an arm and leg for somewhere to stay. However, there are defintely some tricks for getting around this and finding affordable places to rest your head.</p>

    <p>1. Hostels: I know this can seem a little scary at times, but I honestly have never had a bad experience in a hostel! Granted, I have only done this in New York City, but it is a great option for affordable lodging.</p>
    <p>2. AirBnB: This route has become the new popular way to travel! Typically finding just a room is the cheaper option, but you can even find entire homes or apartments to rent that are still cost effective</p>
    <p>3. Pick a hotel, stick with it, earn points: Picking one hotel company and sticking with it everywhere you travel is a great way to earn points and amazing deals on rooms all over the world. If you're not into staying off the beaten path and want a more higher end way to sleep, I definitely recommend this option for you.</p>
